# Image Procesing Application

This is an image processing application developed for CS3500 - Object Oriented Design at Northeastern University in Summer of 2022. This project was made in collaboration with one of my peers in the course, Grace Lemelin. We created this application on Intellij IDEA and used the MVC pattern to design this program. This program can be ran in a terminal window or in a GUI based version. Check out the `USEME.md` to learn more. There are sample images provided in the `/res` folder that can be used on the application along with class diagrams showing the overall structure of the code while we worked through adding new features to the program.
