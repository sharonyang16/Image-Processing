# Image Procesing Application

This is an image processing application developed for CS3500 - Object Oriented Design at Northeastern University in Summer of 2022. This project was created by Grace Lemelin and Sharon yang. This application was developed in Intellij IDEA and utilizes the MVC pattern for the overall structure and design of the program. This program can be ran in a terminal window or in a GUI based version. Check out the `USEME.md` to learn more. There are sample images provided in the `res/` folder that can be used on the application along with class diagrams showing the overall structure of the code while we worked through adding new features to the program.
